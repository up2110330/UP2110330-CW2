# UP2110330-CW2

Draft of information from dataset:

The dataset I have chosen is 'Star dataset to predict star types' by Deepraj Baidya. Its last update was 6 years ago.
The dataset consists of features of stars:
  Absolute temperasture in K
  Relative luminosity
  Relative Radaius
  Absolute magnitide
  Star colour
  Spectral class
  Star type

  The purpose of the dataset is to prove that stars follow a certain graph HR diagram so stars can be classified by plotting their festaures on a graph

The dataset is based on Stefan boltazmann law of blackbodies - luminosity
Wiens displacement - surface temp from wavelength
Absolute magitude relation
Radius from parallax

Took 3 weeks to collect data for 240 stars. Missing data calculated using above.
